# Coherent Optical System Model Used In Laser Microscopy

This project is implementation of coherent optical system model used in laser microscopy. The optical system uses coherent source of light with fixed wavelength. The object is transparent and within object speed of light is less than in a vacuum. A model is developed with the use of Huygens -Fresnel principle. We used mathematical model of thin lens for object implementation. We reconstruct object with phase contrast imaging using a single attenuation grid. With usage of another gird we take measurements for compressive sensing and using those measurements we reconstruct image of high resolution. The model is implemented in a software environment MATLAB
